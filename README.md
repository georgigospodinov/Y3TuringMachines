# Compiling  
The script `./compile` executes javac twice.  
Once to compile the source code, and once to compile the tests.  
  
# Executing  
Use the script `./run`.  
It takes a variable number of arguments to specify what should be run.  
The format is `./run <tm_name> [<input file names>]`  
Examples:  
```bash
# runs 'tm_descriptors/basic.tm' on 'inputs/basic/a_only.in'
./run basic a_only
  
# runs 'tm_descriptors/sort.tm' on 'inputs/sort/hard.in'
./run sort hard
  
# runs 'tm_descriptors/div3.tm' on all files within 'inputs/div3/'
./run div3 
```  
  
If you wish to run util.MakePalindrome or util.Reverse, you can use the commands:  
```bash
java -cp bin util.MakePalindrome <filename>
java -cp bin util.Reverse
```  
The file provided to util.MakePalindrome will be extended.  
util.Reverse expects commandline input that gets printed in reverse.  
  
# Testing  
The JUnit tests can be run from IntelliJ (recommended).  
To run from command line use `./run tests [<test names>]`.  
Examples:  
```bash
# runs the Div5 test class
./run tests Div5
  
# runs the SumSimple and SumCarry test classes
./run tests SumSimple SumCarry
  
# runs all test classes
./run tests 
```  
  
# Generating Input and Data  
If you wish to generate new inputs and data, use the respective classes like this:
```bash
java -cp bin gen.GenerateInputs basic sum  # or other names of TMs
java -cp bin gen.GenerateData  # automatically generates data for the inputs in folder gen.
```  
  
# Notes  
Programs take a couple of seconds to exit after execution completes.  
This is due to a logger thread that is still running and needs to reach the 'not running' condition.  
The script `./clean` can be used to remove all directories and files generated by executing the scripts or classes.  
Specifically, it does `rm -rf bin tapes logs data`.
